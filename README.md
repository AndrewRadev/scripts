This is small repository of useful scripts I've built up over the years. Some I use very often, some I've used once or twice, but still want to keep around in case I need them.

Most of these will have hardcoded stuff in them that's very specific to me and my workflow (like my personal domain, for instance), so if you'd like to use them, you'd have to scan them, figure out how they work, and then adjust them to your needs.

If you're finding them difficult to understand, consider opening an issue. I'll explain the tricky parts and maybe put in some comments for the next person that runs into problems. Please also open an issue (or better yet, a pull request) if you discover any bugs.
