# Renames a mysql database by renaming each individual table. Adapted from:
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/2298602/853920.
#
# New database needs to exist, or you'll get a "generic error" from mysql.
#
# Note that it probably won't move stuff like views or stored procedures. But
# for basic cases, it'll do just fine.
